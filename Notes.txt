let’s review the link created when converting between an array and ArrayList.
4: String[] array = { "gerbil", "mouse" }; // [gerbil, mouse]
5: List<String> list = Arrays.asList(array); // returns fixed size list
6: list.set(1, "test"); // [gerbil, test]
7: array[0] = "new"; // [new, test]
8: String[] array2 = (String[]) list.toArray(); // [new, test]
9: list.remove(1); // throws UnsupportedOperationException

Lines 6 and 7 show that you can change the elements in
either the array or the List. Changes are reflected in both, since they are backed by the
same data.

line 9 shows that list is not resizable because it is backed by the underlying
array.


You’d have to convert the array to a
List and then the List to a Set
